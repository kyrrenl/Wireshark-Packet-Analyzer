This program takes the wireshark text files and sorts through them to calculate a few different things to see what the network strength is like. We used things like Round trip time,
average reply delay, goodput etc. PacketAnalyzer.py is the main file that runs the other files. So I would advise start taking a look at PacketAnalyzer.py as that is the main program
how the program works itself through.
